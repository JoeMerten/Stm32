Some tiny tools and helper scripts
==================================

Whitespace.sh
-------------
Check sources for whitespaces faults (e.g. <CR>, trailing whitespace, tabs and also broken utf-8).
Is also able to correct some of those faults.

Pulog.sh
--------
Dumb script for uart logging. E.g. when running unittests on bare metal targsts.
